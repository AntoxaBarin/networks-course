27.4.1 Iterator traits [iterator.traits]
1 To implement algorithms only in terms of iterators, it is often necessary to determine the value and difference
types that correspond to a particular iterator type. Accordingly, it is required that if Iterator is the type of
an iterator, the types
iterator_traits<Iterator>::difference_type
iterator_traits<Iterator>::value_type
iterator_traits<Iterator>::iterator_category
be defined as the iterator’s difference type, value type and iterator category, respectively. In addition, the types
iterator_traits<Iterator>::reference
iterator_traits<Iterator>::pointer
shall be defined as the iterator’s reference and pointer types, that is, for an iterator object a, the same type
as the type of *a and a->, respectively. In the case of an output iterator, the types
iterator_traits<Iterator>::difference_type
iterator_traits<Iterator>::value_type
iterator_traits<Iterator>::reference
iterator_traits<Iterator>::pointer
may be defined as void.
